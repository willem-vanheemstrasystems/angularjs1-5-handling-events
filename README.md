#Handling Events in AngularJS

For example:

1. Display a list of technologies in a table
2. Provide the ability to like and dislike a technology
3. Increment the likes and dislikes when the respective buttons are clicked

See the script.js and index.html file for how this is implemented, using the ```ng-click``` directive and two methods in the controller function; ```incrementLikes(technology)``` and ```incrementDislikes(technology)```.
